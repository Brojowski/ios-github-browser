# Github Gist Browser

This app was completed for CS 54003 - iOS App Development.  

The app allows users to save Github Gists of interest so they can look back at them later. A user will copy the URL of a 
gist and copy+paste it into the app. The app parses the URL to get the username and id of the gist. The user defines a name 
that allows them to look this gist up later.  

When a user clicks on a gist, they are able to see all of its files. When they open a file, the are able to see the code with
syntax highlighting.
